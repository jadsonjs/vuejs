# vuejs

This repository contains several VUE.js (https://vuejs.org) small projects that show the power of VUE.js.

Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

Vue.js features an incrementally adoptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.
